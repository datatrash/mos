# Changelog

## 0.7.0 (unreleased)

### New features
* Error formatting is improved and made configurable through the `--error-style` option
* A listing file can be generated for every segment by specifying `listing = true` in the `[build]` section of `mos.toml`
* Instead of just generating a Commodore-compatible `.prg` file, it is now also possible to generate a raw binary or a raw binary per segment

### Notable bugfixes
* Nested macros are now looked up correctly ([#168](https://github.com/datatrash/mos/issues/168))
* Symbol resolution doesn't return incorrect symbols when lookups fail halfway through
* Error reporting shows correct paths on Windows now, instead of UNC paths ([#192](https://github.com/datatrash/mos/issues/192)) 
* Files imported from subdirectories are resolved in a platform-independent way (i.e. forward or backslashes may be used)
* Uninvoked macros and untaken if/else paths now get proper refactoring support ([#180](https://github.com/datatrash/mos/issues/180))
* When attempting to debug with an unsupported version of VICE a proper error message is created ([#186](https://github.com/datatrash/mos/issues/186))
* Syntax grammar files were not packaged in the VSCode extension ([#185](https://github.com/datatrash/mos/issues/185))
